title: How I Made This Blog	
---
As my first post I want to write down how I set up this blog. 

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) an open-source static site generator based on Ruby. [The project's readme describes Jekyll as](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

I use it in conjunction with the Jekyll Theme [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

[GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a great and free way to host your static website and it nativly supports Jekyll. You just need to push your Jekyll page to a GitHub repository and your page will automatically be deployed on GitHub-Pages.

There are quite a few guides on setting up a Jekyll website but I still struggled a bit a long the way so maybe in writing down how I did it I can help somebody else out.

Jekyll is based on Ruby so the first thing you need to do is install it. I had no experience with Ruby before setting up the blog. If you use a Mac it will come with a version of Ruby preinstalled but you will soon notice that you can't make any changes to that version so you'll need to install a seperate one.

To make things easier I used the the Ruby environment tool [Chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby). Once you have your Ruby enviroment set up you can install Jekyll to get started. If you want to build a website from scratch you can follow the gudie in the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/).

Or you if you want to do it like I did and start with a pre existing theme then head over to [this overview of Jekyll themes on Github](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme).

To use a theme (in my case [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.) what you need to to is fork the repository of the theme.
